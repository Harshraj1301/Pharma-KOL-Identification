## Project Overview

In a case competition hosted by ProcDNA, I led a team to develop an advanced scoring and network model using Bayesian analysis to identify influential Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) for Bright Life’s NeuroShield launch. NeuroShield is a wearable, non-invasive device designed for early Parkinson’s intervention therapy.

## Project Highlights

### Data Collection
- Extracted data from clinical trials, research publications, leadership positions, and open payment records using Python libraries and APIs.

### Data Preprocessing
- Cleansed and structured the data for enhanced reliability, performed feature engineering, and conducted outlier detection.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified trends and correlations to inform feature selection and optimization.

### Model Building
- Created a heuristic scoring model and network model to rank KOLs based on their influence using Bayesian analysis.

### Recommendations
- Developed a strategic plan for engaging top KOLs to support the product launch, ensuring ongoing accuracy and adaptability through a dashboard.

## Outcome
- Secured a top-three position among 42 teams in the competition.
- Provided a comprehensive analysis methodology and strategic insights for the successful launch and adoption of NeuroShield.
